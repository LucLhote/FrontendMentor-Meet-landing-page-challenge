## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

I was able to work with wireframes to prepare for this project. It's the first time and I realized how much easier it is under these conditions for a front-end developer. I'm one of those people who pay a lot of attention to detail to get the best version of my work so wireframes are essential.
